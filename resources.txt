Linear Algebra and Programming Fundamentals (May 17â€“23, 2025)
Goal: Build a foundation in linear algebra and programming concepts.

Linear Algebra :
Resource: Khan Academy: Linear Algebra https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra
Topics: Matrices (addition, multiplication, inverses), vectors (dot product, norms), determinants, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, linear transformations


Advanced Linear Algebra:
Resource: 3Blue1Brown: Essence of Linear Algebra (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab, free).
Topics: Vector spaces, linear transformations, applications in machine learning (e.g., PCA, neural network weights).
Practice: Solve problems on eigenvalues for ML (e.g., covariance matrix in PCA).
