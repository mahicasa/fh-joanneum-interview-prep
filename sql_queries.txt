# Query 1: Retrieve Running Servers - Retrieves the ID and uptime of all servers with a “running” status

SELECT instance_id, uptime
FROM servers
WHERE status = 'running';

# Query 2: Join Servers and Regions - Joins the servers and regions tables to list instance IDs in the us-east-1 region. I’d use this in SAP ERP or AWS to analyze regional resource distribution, applicable to AI data pipelines.

SELECT s.instance_id, r.region_name
FROM servers s
INNER JOIN regions r ON s.region_id = r.id
WHERE r.region_name = 'us-east-1';


=============

What is the third normal form (3NF), and why is it important?”
Answer: 3NF ensures a table is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the primary key). For example, in a table [OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerCity], CustomerCity depends on CustomerID, not OrderID, so it’s moved to a separate table. 3NF reduces redundancy and improves data integrity, critical for efficient database design.
